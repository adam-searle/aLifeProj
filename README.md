# aLifeProj
A project for the module Artificial Life. I evolved agent based robots in a grid world, enforcing co-operation, with the aim of observing perceptual strategies.

Code is run from 'Main Script' if you want to make sense of the code the best way would be to start here and follow the chain of functions.

The general idea is that an agent based robot, or robots, are randomly generated and set to forage around a grid world for resources. Their genotype contains genes for perceptions and actions. Their performance works as a fitness function for the genetic algorithm. 

For a more detailed explanation feel free to get in contact.
